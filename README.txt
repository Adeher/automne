Installation : step by step
---------------------------

 	2. Create a database (it's only a single click in phpMyAdmin) or be sure to have access to an existing database
	3. Launch install.php from a web browser. The install process will check your server configuration (see http://www.automne-cms.org/requirements/) for more details), create the database tables, etc.
	If you have any trouble during the install process you can always mail us the diagnostic file generated by Automne at contact[at]automne.ws or visit our forum.
	4. IF PHP CLI is available, choose the "background script" option during the installation.
	5. Once the installation is over, you are invited to login to your website. The default username is 'root' and the password is 'automne'. Then click on User Profile to change the default password.
	6. In order to keep your webserver secure we recommend you to delete both install.php, automne-xxx.tar.gz and demo-xx.tgz
